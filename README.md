<br />

Gitlab CI Dashboard will provide you with a **global** overview of all pipelines, schedules, and their statuses within a
single group.
The default functionality of Gitlab is limited at the project level. This can become hard to manage when you have a lot
of
projects, potentially resulting in undetected failed pipelines.

## üëâ [Demo](https://gitlab-ci-dashboard.larscom.nl)

<br />

## üöÄ Highlights

- View all pipeline statuses per group (e.g: failed/canceled/success)
- View all pipeline schedules per group
- You won't get rate limited by the Gitlab API, due to server-side caching
- Communication to the Gitlab API happens only server side
- Only 1 `read only` token is needed to serve a whole team
    - Optionally use a `read/write` token to perform actions like restarting failed pipelines, create new pipelines or
      cancel pipelines.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Gitlab server (v4 API)
- API token (read only or read/write)
- Docker

## üí° Getting started

1. Generate a `read_api` or `api` access token in Gitlab, depending on your requirements (
   e.g: https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens)

![Access Token](https://github.com/larscom/gitlab-ci-dashboard/blob/main/.github/img/access_token.png)

2. Run docker with the required environment variables (GITLAB_BASE_URL, GITLAB_API_TOKEN)

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.com \
  -e GITLAB_API_TOKEN=my_token \
  larscom/gitlab-ci-dashboard:latest
```

Or you can run it with a TOML configration file

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.com \
  -e GITLAB_API_TOKEN=my_token \
  -v ./config.toml:/app/config.toml \
  larscom/gitlab-ci-dashboard:latest
```

3. Dashboard should be available at: http://localhost:8080/ showing (by default) all available groups and their
   projects

## üëâ Create/Cancel/Retry Pipelines

You are able to perform write operations like creating,canceling,retrying pipelines, but you need to set the environment
variable: `API_READ_ONLY` to `false` and provide a valid `read/write` access token.

## üëâ Hide the 'write' operations button

You are able to hide the ellipsis (...) when you just want to use `READ_ONLY` mode. Set the `UI_HIDE_WRITE_ACTIONS` to
true.

## ‚è∞ Prometheus

Prometheus metrics are exposed on the following endpoint

> http://localhost:8080/metrics/prometheus

## üîå Configration

You have the option to set the configuration via environment variables or a TOML file.
A TOML file takes precedence over environment variables, except for the `RUST_LOG` variable.

### Load from TOML file

> An example TOML file can be found inside the `./api` folder.

Mount the `config.toml` inside the container (`/app/config.toml`)

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.com \
  -e GITLAB_API_TOKEN=my_token \
  -v ./config.toml:/app/config.toml \
  larscom/gitlab-ci-dashboard:latest
```

## üìú Custom CA certificate
If you are running a gitlab instance that is using a TLS certificate signed with a private CA you are able to provide that CA as mount (PEM encoded)

This is needed when the dashboard backend is unable to make a connection to the gitlab API over HTTPS.

Mount the `ca.crt` inside the container (`/app/certs/ca.crt`)

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.com \
  -e GITLAB_API_TOKEN=my_token \
  -v ./ca.crt:/app/certs/ca.crt \
  larscom/gitlab-ci-dashboard:latest
```

### Troubleshooting
If you are still unable to connect with a custom CA cert, be sure that the gitlab server certificate contains a valid SAN (Subject Alternative Name)

If there is a mismatch the HTTP client is still unable to make a proper connection.
